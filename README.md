# disclaimer
I am not the author of the software. 
I only converted the code to be python3-pyqt5 compatible.
You can find the original software here:

# install
```
brew install pyqt;
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
if you don't have pip3 installed you'll need to run this first:
```
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
python get-pip.py
```

# run
```
python3 src/mainWindow.py
```
